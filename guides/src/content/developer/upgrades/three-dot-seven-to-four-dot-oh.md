title: Upgrading Spree 3.7 to 4.0

This guide covers upgrading a **3.7 Spree application** to **Spree 4.0**. 

If you have any questions or suggestions feel free to reach out through [Spree slack channels](http://slack.spreecommerce.org/)

**If you're on an older version than 3.7 please follow previous upgrade guides and perform those upgrades incrementally**, eg.

1. [upgrade 3.2 to 3.3](/developer/upgrades/three-dot-two-to-three-dot-three.html)
2. [upgrade 3.3 to 3.4](/developer/upgrades/three-dot-three-to-three-dot-four.html)
3. [upgrade 3.4 to 3.5](/developer/upgrades/three-dot-four-to-three-dot-five.html)
4. [upgrade 3.5 to 3.6](/developer/upgrades/three-dot-five-to-three-dot-six.html)
5. [upgrade 3.6 to 3.7](/developer/upgrades/three-dot-six-to-three-dot-seven.html)

This is the safest and recommended method.

### Update your Ruby version to 2.5.0 at least

Spree 4.0 and Rails 6.0 require Ruby 2.5.0 at least so you need to bump the ruby version in your project's `Gemfile` and `.ruby-version` files.

### Update your Rails version to 6.0

Please follow the
[official Rails guide](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#upgrading-from-rails-5-2-to-rails-6-0)
to upgrade your store.

### Migrate from Paperclip to ActiveStorage

In Spree 3.6 we deprecated [Paperclip support in favour of ActiveStorage](/release_notes/3_6_0.html#active-storage-support). Paperclip gem itself isn't maintained anymore and it is recommended to move to ActiveStorage as it is the defualt Rails storage engine since Rails 5.2 release.

In Spree 4.0 we completely removed Paperclip support in favour of ActiveStorage.

Please follow the [official Paperclip to ActiveStorage migration guide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/blob/master/MIGRATING.md)

### Replace OrderContents with services in your codebase

`OrderContents` was deprecated in Spree 3.7 and removed in 4.0. We've replaced it with [service objects](/release_notes/3_7_0.html#service-oriented-architecture).

You need to replace any instances of `OrderContents` usage with coresponding services in your codebase.

#### `OrderContents#update_cart`

before:

```ruby
order.contents.update_cart(line_items_attributes)
```

after:

```ruby
Spree::Cart::Update.call(order: order, params: line_items_attributes)
```

#### `OrderContents#add`

before:

```ruby
order.contents.add(variant, quantity, shipment: shipment)
```

after:

```ruby
Spree::Cart::AddItem.call(
  order: order,
  variant: variant,
  quantity: quantity,
  options: {
    shipment: @shipment
  }
)
```

#### `OrderContents#remove`

before:

```ruby
order.contents.remove(variant, quantity, shipment: shipment)
```

after:

```ruby
Spree::Cart::RemoveItem.call(
  order: order,
  variant: variant,
  quantity: quantity,
  options: {
    shipment: shipment
  }
)
```

### Replace `add_store_credit_payments` with `Checkout::AddStoreCredit`

Similar to `OrderContents` method `add_store_credit_payments` was replaced with `Checkout::AddStoreCredit` service.

before:

```ruby
order.add_store_credit_payments
```

after:

```ruby
Spree::Checkout::AddStoreCredit.call(order: order)
```

### Replace `remove_store_credit_payments` with `Checkout::RemoveStoreCredit`

Similar to `OrderContents` method `remove_store_credit_payments` was replaced with `Checkout::RemeoveStoreCredit` service.

before:

```ruby
order.remove_store_credit_payments
```

after:

```ruby
Spree::Checkout::RemoveStoreCredit.call(order: order)
```

### Remove `spree_address_book` extension

If you're using [Address Book](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_address_book) extension you need to remove it from your Gemfile as this feature was [merged into core Spree](/release_notes/4_0_0.html#address-book-support).

### Update Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'spree', '~> 4.0'
gem 'spree_auth_devise', '~> 4.0'
gem 'spree_gateway', '~> 3.6'
```

### Run `bundle update`

### Install missing migrations

```bash
rails spree:install:migrations
rails spree_api:install:migrations
rails spree_auth:install:migrations
rails spree_gateway:install:migrations
```

### Run migrations

```bash
rails db:migrate
```
